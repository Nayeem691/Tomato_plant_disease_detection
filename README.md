# Tomato_plant_disease_detection
Identification of diseases from the images of a tomato leaf is one of the interesting research areas in the agriculture field, for which machine learning concepts of computer field can be applied. My research presents a prototype system for detection and classification of tomato leaf diseases based on the images of infected tomato leaf. I consider 10 tomato diseases named Bacterial_spot, Early_blight, late_blight, Leaf_Mold, Septoria_leaf_spot, Spider_mites Two-spotted_spider_mite, Target_Spot, Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus, Tomato_mosaic_virus, healthy. It can also detect Healthy leafs. In this research, I used deep learning based model (CNN) for classification. First, I pre-processed the image dataset very carefully because preprocessing is the most important part of this research. Then I trained my model and validate according to the dataset. I test various techniques for this research but faster rcnn works pretty well for my dataset, it gives an accuracy level of 89%. If there is no image of the tomato leaf then it can also be detected.
